<p>Below you will find the 3 files for the Background Generator. A few things you can try: <br><br>1. Write code so that the colour inputs match the background generated on the first page load.&nbsp;<br><br>2. Display the initial CSS linear gradient property on page load.<br><br>3. BONUS: Add a random button which generates two random numbers for the colour inputs.<br><br>You may also see different behaviours with the Color widget based on what browser you use. Remember, all browsers are implemented differently. Good luck!<br><br><br>PS -&nbsp;if you have any questions,&nbsp;reach out to our student community in the<strong>&nbsp;#js</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>#helpme</strong>&nbsp;channel on Discord (Lecture 2 provides the link if you have not yet joined)!</p>
